# Campaign Data Multiple Entries Feature

## Overview

The campaign data system has been updated to allow users to create multiple entries for the same campaign on the same date. This removes the previous restriction that limited users to only one campaign data entry per campaign per date.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**Migration:** `remove_campaign_data_unique_constraint.sql`

- **Removed:** `UNIQUE KEY unique_campaign_date (campaign_id, data_date)` constraint from the `campaign_data` table
- **Impact:** Users can now create unlimited campaign data entries for any campaign on any date

**Before:**
```sql
UNIQUE KEY `unique_campaign_date` (`campaign_id`,`data_date`)
```

**After:**
```sql
-- Constraint removed - multiple entries per campaign per date are now allowed
```

### 2. Backend Controller Updates

**File:** `controllers/campaignDataController.js`

**Changes Made:**
- **Updated `handleDatabaseError` function** to remove the specific handling of duplicate entry errors for campaign data dates
- **Improved error handling** to provide more specific messages for other types of duplicate entry errors (e.g., card codes)
- **Added comments** explaining that multiple entries per date are now allowed

**Before:**
```javascript
if (error && error.code === 'ER_DUP_ENTRY') {
  return {
    statusCode: 409,
    response: createResponse(false, 'Campaign data for this date already exists. Use update instead.')
  };
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Note: Removed ER_DUP_ENTRY handling for campaign_data dates as multiple entries per date are now allowed
if (error && error.code === 'ER_DUP_ENTRY') {
  // Handle other potential duplicate entry errors (like card_code uniqueness)
  if (error.message && error.message.includes('card_code')) {
    return {
      statusCode: 409,
      response: createResponse(false, 'A card with this code already exists.')
    };
  }
  // For other duplicate entries, provide a generic message
  return {
    statusCode: 409,
    response: createResponse(false, 'Duplicate entry detected. Please check your data.')
  };
}
```

## User Experience Impact

### Before the Change
- ❌ Users would see error: "Campaign data for this date already exists. Use update instead."
- ❌ Only one campaign data entry allowed per campaign per date
- ❌ Users had to update existing entries instead of creating new ones

### After the Change
- ✅ Users can create unlimited campaign data entries for any campaign on any date
- ✅ No more restrictive error messages about date conflicts
- ✅ More flexible data entry workflow
- ✅ Better support for multiple data points per day (e.g., morning and evening results)

## Use Cases Enabled

1. **Multiple Time Periods**: Track morning vs evening campaign performance
2. **Different Data Sources**: Record data from different platforms or tools
3. **A/B Testing**: Track multiple variations of the same campaign on the same date
4. **Data Corrections**: Add corrected data without removing original entries
5. **Detailed Reporting**: Capture granular performance metrics throughout the day

## API Behavior

### Creating Campaign Data
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/campaign-data`
- **Behavior:** No longer validates for existing entries with the same campaign_id and data_date
- **Response:** Standard success response for all valid entries

### Example Request
```json
{
  "campaign_id": 1,
  "facebook_result": 150,
  "zoho_result": 200,
  "spent": 250.75,
  "data_date": "2025-09-12",
  "card_id": 1
}
```

**Multiple requests with the same campaign_id and data_date will now all succeed.**

## Database Impact

- **Performance:** Minimal impact - the unique constraint removal doesn't significantly affect query performance
- **Data Integrity:** Other constraints (foreign keys, data types) remain intact
- **Storage:** Allows for more granular data storage per campaign per date
- **Indexing:** Regular indexes on `campaign_id` and `data_date` still provide good query performance

## Testing

The functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Multiple entries can be created for the same campaign and date
- ✅ No duplicate entry errors are thrown
- ✅ All existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ Data retrieval and filtering work correctly with multiple entries

## Migration Information

- **Migration File:** `remove_campaign_data_unique_constraint.sql`
- **Applied:** 2025-09-12
- **Reversible:** Yes, the unique constraint can be re-added if needed (but existing duplicate data would need to be cleaned up first)

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing API endpoints continue to work as before
- ✅ Existing data is preserved and unaffected
- ✅ Frontend applications require no changes to support this feature
- ✅ All validation and business logic remains the same except for the date restriction

## Support and Maintenance

- **Monitoring:** No additional monitoring required
- **Backup:** Standard database backup procedures apply
- **Rollback:** To revert, the unique constraint would need to be re-added after resolving any duplicate data

This change significantly improves the flexibility of the campaign data system while maintaining data integrity and system performance.
