# 🚀 Campaigns Module Setup & Testing Guide

## ✅ What's Fixed

Your Campaigns module backend API was already working perfectly! I've now fixed the frontend issues:

### Backend (Already Working) ✅
- ✅ **View campaigns** - GET `/api/campaigns` 
- ✅ **View single campaign** - GET `/api/campaigns/:id`
- ✅ **Edit campaigns** - PUT `/api/campaigns/:id`
- ✅ **Delete campaigns** - DELETE `/api/campaigns/:id`
- ✅ **Create campaigns** - POST `/api/campaigns`
- ✅ **Toggle status** - PATCH `/api/campaigns/:id/toggle-status`

### Frontend (Fixed) 🔧
- ✅ **API Connection**: Updated to connect to correct backend port (5000)
- ✅ **Button Interactions**: Fixed dropdown menu click handling
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Added proper error messages and loading states
- ✅ **UI Responsiveness**: Improved button accessibility and focus states

### 2. Start Frontend Server

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Buttons Still Don't Work:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Look for failed network requests

2. **Verify Backend Connection**
   - Open http://localhost:5000/api/health in browser
   - Should show server status

3. **Test API Directly**
   ```powershell
   # Test get campaigns
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/campaigns" -Method GET
   ```

4. **Check Network Tab**
   - Press F12 → Network tab
   - Perform actions and check if API calls are being made
   - Look for 404, 500, or CORS errors

### Common Issues & Solutions:

❌ **"Network Error"**
→ Backend server not running - start with `npm start`

❌ **CORS Error**
→ Backend already configured for CORS - should work

❌ **Buttons not clickable**
→ Clear browser cache and refresh page

❌ **Empty dropdown menu**
→ Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## 📞 Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check both backend and frontend terminals for error messages

3. Test the API endpoints directly using the backend test scripts I created
4. Check browser developer tools for network and console errors

Your campaigns module should now be fully functional! 🎉
