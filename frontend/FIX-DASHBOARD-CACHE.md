# Fix Dashboard Cache Issue

## Problem
The dashboard is not showing updated campaign data because of caching. The dashboard service caches API responses for 5 minutes, and when you update campaign data, the dashboard doesn't know to refresh its cache.

## Solution
I've implemented several fixes to solve this caching issue:

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard Service
- Added `forceRefresh()` method that bypasses all caching and debouncing
- Added individual force fetch methods for each endpoint
- Added cache busting parameters (`?_t=${Date.now()}`) to API calls

### 2. Improved Dashboard Component
- Updated refresh functionality to use the new force refresh methods
- Added two refresh buttons:
  - **Refresh**: Quick refresh for current tab only
  - **Hard Refresh**: Complete cache clear and refresh all data

### 3. Browser Cache Clearing Script
- Created `clear-dashboard-cache.js` script to clear browser cache manually

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Hard Refresh Button
1. Open your dashboard at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click the blue **"Hard Refresh"** button in the top-right corner
3. This will clear all cache and fetch fresh data from the API
4. The dashboard should now show your updated campaign data

### Option 2: Use Browser Console Script
1. Open your dashboard in the browser
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Copy and paste the contents of `clear-dashboard-cache.js`
5. Press **Enter** to run the script
6. Use the `forceDashboardRefresh()` function or refresh the page

### Option 3: Hard Browser Refresh
1. Open your dashboard
2. Press **Ctrl+F5** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
3. This forces a complete page reload bypassing all browser cache

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/dashboardService.js` - Added force refresh methods
2. `src/services/safeDashboardService.js` - Added cache busting
3. `src/modules/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated refresh functionality
4. `clear-dashboard-cache.js` - New utility script

## Verification Steps
After applying the fix:
1. Update some campaign data in your backend
2. Go to dashboard and click "Hard Refresh"
3. Verify the dashboard shows the updated data
4. Check browser console for force refresh logs

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
- Use the "Hard Refresh" button after making campaign updates
- The dashboard cache timeout is set to 5 minutes, so normal refreshes will work after that time
- Consider integrating real-time updates or WebSocket notifications for instant updates

## Debug Information
If the issue persists:
1. Check browser console for any error messages
2. Use the `browser_debug_test.js` script to test API connectivity
3. Verify the backend is running and accessible
4. Check network tab in developer tools for API call responses

The dashboard should now properly refresh and show your updated campaign data!
